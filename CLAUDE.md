# pwa-landlord

For a landlord: one dashboard to control every house under management. Sibling app: `pwa-tenant`. Made from `pwa-template`.
Plain HTML, CSS and ES modules, no build step and no dependencies.

## Commands

```sh
npm test                           # unit tests (node --test)
npm run serve                      # http://localhost:8080
npm run icons                      # write the PNG icons again from icons/source.png
npm run init -- <slug> "<Name>"    # turn a copy into a new app (once)
npm run release                    # bump, commit and tag vX.Y.Z; git push --follow-tags deploys

## Changelog and release notes

- `CHANGELOG.md` is the technical record, in English.
- `release-notes/<lang>.md` is what a user reads in the app, one file for each catalog of
  `src/locales/`. A user-visible change adds a bullet under `Unreleased` in every file, in the
  same commit. `npm run release` stops when only some languages have one.
